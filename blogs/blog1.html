    <p>So far i feel like i have learned quite a bit in only the few days we have had in class. The main thing is that between html and css there are multiple ways to do things. Before i started the treehouse classes and our actual class i was under the impression that coding was a right and wrong sort of thing. I'm pleasantly surprised to find that you can do things however you see fit. With html only I was happy to know that most of it is very basic and you mainly just need to remember the structure of a page and what child elements belong t other elements. The main thing Ive noticed for myself is that i need to pay attention to my spelling and syntax(dont forget brackets!). With css i was super relieved when Zoe had expressed that its impossible to remember all css rules. Its comforting to know that im not the only person who may have to look up ho to change the font of all h3s on the page for instance. I do really enjoy the fact that css is very straight forward, or atleast in my opinion. When i look at a stylesheet i feel that i roughly know exactly what the different entries are changing on the page. Most of all though, i love that github is alot easier then i had imagined. My only struggle to being was making directories and then forgetting to enter them causing me to make repositories in the wrong directories. Now though it is second nature to use the pwd command to make sure im in the right area before making any changes. I also feel that at this point i have a good grasp on creating branches as well as just navigating git bash.</p>
